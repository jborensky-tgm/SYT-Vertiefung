**exploratory data analysis** (in R and Python)

## Introduction

EDA (exploratory data analysis) is used to understand different data sets by looking at their main characteristics and even plotting them visually to understand them better. 

In this document, I would like to discuss the fundamental techniques as well as the concrete implementations of these techniques in R and Python.  

Data Analysis is and will get much more important in the future. In 2007 it was assumed that the total quantity of data that was produced until then was about five exabytes ($5 \cdot 10^{18} bytes$) . At that point of time it was more than the estimated number of words spoken by humans. [1]
